### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... My personal business website along with BloomTechs course.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... The fundamentals of full stack development at Bloom Institute of Technology.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can simply email me at mooresj15@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... I was a self taught developer. I started in 2017 but being self taught, I didn't get the learn the fundamentals of any languages. I learned Angular before it was known as angular js. Looking back at all of my issues that I had when coding I know majority of them would've been solved if I went to school before diving straight into coding.
